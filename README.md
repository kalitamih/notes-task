1. You need to download this repository, go to the second folder 'notes-task' and install dependencies.
2. You can launch this application locally by 'npm start'. But you also need to launch command 'npm run json-server' in the separate window, because I use 'json-server' to store data in local file. 
3. You can see application by this link 'https://kalitamih.github.io/notes-task/'. I deployed it on gh-pages. I also deployed 'json-server' on heroku.
